    "## 1 - Brief words\n",
    "\n",
    "- According to Ondrášek (2010), in his work entitled [Masculine Identity in Chuck Palahniuk's Early Novels](https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/31714/DPTX_2010_1_11410_0_76970_0_91540.pdf?sequence=1), there is a common theme in Chuck Palaniuhk's early works: male identity.\n",
    "- Despite the superficial exposition of this concept, the theme shapes the style (form) and content (substance) of the narrative. Let's agree that Palahniuk's minimalist style is unique for discarding adjective \"flourishes\".\n",
    "- In this sense, there is a thesis that the programmed repetitions (similar to the \"for\" loop in python) in Palahnuik's work may represent a technique of aesthetic assimilation with fascism. The repetition of an idea leads to the penetration of that same idea into the unconscious level. \n",
    "- Repetition has the notion of frequency, frequency of words can be represented by word cloud.\n"
